## Configuration:

1. Rename the user.ini.config to user.ini.
1. Edit the user.ini with information that is relevant to your install.
2. If you are downloading/syncing remotely you must enter your myplex information and enable myplex.
3. Start by running "python plexdl.py".

## Find the section ID
You can find your movie/music/tv/photo section ID by visiting your Plex Web and going to the category you want to sync. Example:
```
http://localhost:32400/web/index.html#!/server/.../section/2
```
The ID you are looking for is the number at the end which in the above example is 2.

You can also find your content section ID by visiting:
```
http://localhost:32400/library/sections/
```

## User.ini

Note that if you need to give a `%` (percent) sign in one of the following fields, you will
actually need to double it. So for example if your password is `my%password`, you will need
to set the field as such: `password=my%%password`.

```ini
